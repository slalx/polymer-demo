Currently these technologies are implemented as polyfills or shims, but as browsers adopt these features natively, the platform code that drives Polymer evacipates, leaving only the value-adds.\n\n## Tools & Testing\n\nFor running tests or building minified files, consult the [tooling information](http://www.polymer-project.org/resources/tooling-strategy.html).\n",
